# ML_streamlit_app
 An Interactive ML app by Streamlit
Business Problem:
    It is observed that the analytics team had trouble communicating their findings to the firm's management. It is also noticed that management receives just a small portion of what the analytics team provides to them (perhaps about 32%). The analytics team delivers their results to management in a raw Jupyter Notebook alongside the code and tries to explain it to them in a way that is difficult for them to understand. 
Objective:
    This aims to help the analytics team communicate better with management. Using Streamlit, this interactive web application would help them better demonstration of their findings to the management of the business.
